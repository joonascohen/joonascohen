Working as a SysAdmin @ HP

Love to explore and learn new technologies, especially pertaining to Linux

Some of the stuff I've been focusing on is:
- Bash Scripting
- NixOS
- Reproduceability of my configuration (both through standard [dotfiles](https://github.com/joonascohen/dot.files) and through NixOS
